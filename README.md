# **Heart Attack Risk Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using a variety of health and lifestyle features. We use machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict the risk of a heart attack based on various factors such as cholesterol, heart rate, family history, smoking habits, and more.

The objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict heart attack risk, which can be used to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk and enabling preventive measures.

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset used for this project contains various health-related features that can influence the likelihood of a heart attack. The features include:

- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol levels in the blood.
- **Heart rate**: The individual's resting heart rate.
- **Diabetes**: Whether the individual has diabetes.
- **Family History**: A history of heart disease in the family.
- **Smoking**: Whether the individual is a smoker.
- **Obesity**: Body Mass Index (BMI) indicating obesity.
- **Alcohol Consumption**: The individual's alcohol consumption habits.
- **Exercise Hours Per Week**: Amount of physical activity the individual engages in weekly.
- **Diet**: The individual's eating habits.
- **Previous Heart Problems**: Whether the individual has had prior heart-related issues.
- **Medication Use**: Whether the individual is taking heart-related medications.
- **Stress Level**: The individual's stress levels.
- **Sedentary Hours Per Day**: The number of hours spent being sedentary per day.
- **Income**: The individual's income level.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the individual.
- **Triglycerides**: Levels of triglycerides in the blood.
- **Physical Activity Days Per Week**: Number of days the individual engages in physical activity weekly.
- **Sleep Hours Per Day**: The individual's average sleep hours per day.
- **Heart Attack Risk (Binary)**: The target variable (1 = heart attack risk, 0 = no risk).
- **Blood Sugar**: The individual's blood sugar level.
- **CK-MB**: An enzyme marker for heart damage.
- **Troponin**: A protein involved in heart muscle contraction.
- **Heart Attack Risk (Text)**: A textual description of the individual's risk.
- **Gender**: The individual's gender.
- **Systolic Blood Pressure**: The top number in blood pressure readings.
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure**: The bottom number in blood pressure readings.

## **Data Source**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It contains data collected from various medical records and health surveys, making it a rich source for training predictive models.
